#~~ Формат записи для автоматического открытия списка методов объекта после ввода разделителя:
#~~ [Объект][Символ разделителя][Метод], т.е.
#~~ WshShell.AppActivate

#~~ Формат записи синонимов (без них список методов будет открываться ТОЛЬКО при точном соответсвии имени объекта с записью в этом файле):
#~~ [Символ # в начале строки и за ним без пробела][Имя объекта в этом файле]=[Стринг для его создания], т.е.
#~~ #WshShell=WScript.Shell

#~~ Всплывающие посказки:
#~~ Неправильная запись (чтобы она сработала необходимо выполнение многих нехороших условий)
#~~ WshShell.AppActivate(App as Variant[, Wait as Variant]) as Boolean
#~~ Правильная запись (метод и содержимое подсказки записываются отдельной строкой)
#~~ AppActivate(App as Variant[, Wait as Variant]) as Boolean
